# Predicting Winning Models with Logistic Regression
* In the following notebook and paper, I worked on creating a logistic regression model to classify a winning LLM model from a pairwise combinations of LLMs with ChatbotArena data.
* This was a project for Berkeley's Data 200 done in conjunction with Sonja Bumann, who covered Task B, predicting the difficulty of a given question.
